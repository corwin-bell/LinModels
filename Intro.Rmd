## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
install.packages("UsingR")
```

```{r}
library(UsingR)
data("father.son",package="UsingR")
```

```{r}
mean(father.son$sheight)
```
Create a list of son heights for sons that have fathers with heights of 71 inches (round to the nearest inch).
```{r}
sheight_list <-father.son[father.son$fheight>70.5 & father.son$fheight<71.5,"sheight"]
mean(sheight_list)
```

```{r}
X = matrix(1:1000,100,10)
```

Using the function cbind, create a 10 x 5 matrix with first column x=1:10. Then columns 2*x, 3*x, 4*x and 5*x in columns 2 through 5.
What is the sum of the elements of the 7th row?
```{r}
x = 1:10
x2 = x*2
x3 = x*3
x4 = x*4
x5 = x*5
x_merge <- cbind(x,x2,x3,x4,x5)
rowSums(x_merge)
```
X*X^-1=I
I do not understand why my answer is different than the tutorial. Also not clear to me why this solves the system of equations
```{r}
X <- matrix(c(1,3,2,1-2,1,1,1,-1),3,3)
y <- matrix(c(6,2,1),3,1)
solve(X)%*%y
```
Solve the following system of equations using R:

3a + 4b - 5c + d = 10

2a + 2b + 2c - d = 5

a -b + 5c - 5d = 7

5a + d = 4
```{r}
X <- matrix(c(3,4,-5,1,2,2,2,-1,1,-1,5,-5,5,0,0,1),4,4,byrow = TRUE)
y <- matrix(c(10,5,7,4),4,1)
solve(X)%*%y
```
```{r}
a <- matrix(1:12, nrow=4)
b <- matrix(1:15, nrow=3)
a%*%b
```
Multiply the 3rd row of 'a' with the 2nd column of 'b', using the element-wise vector multiplication with *.
What is the sum of the elements in the resulting vector?
```{r}
 sum(a[3,]*b[,2])
```
Equivalent to dot product function in Python
```{r}
crossprod(a[3,],b[,2])
```
```{r}
x=father.son$fheight
y=father.son$sheight
X <-cbind(1,x)
betahat <-solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)%*%y
betahat
```
### Matrix Algbra Examples
Suppose we are analyzing a set of 4 samples. The first two samples are from a treatment group A and the second two samples are from a treatment group B. This design can be represented with a model matrix like so:
```{r}
X <- matrix(c(1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1),nrow=4)
rownames(X) <- c("a","a","b","b")
```
X matrix will then look like:
```{r}
X
```

Suppose that the fitted parameters for a linear model give us:
```{r}
beta <- c(5, 2)
beta
```


Use the matrix multiplication operator, %*%, in R to answer the following questions:

What is the fitted value for the A samples? (The fitted Y values.)
```{r}
X[1:2,] %*% beta
```
What is the fitted value for the B samples? (The fitted Y values.)
```{r}
X[3:4,] %*% beta
```


Suppose now we are comparing two treatments B and C to a control group A, each with two samples. This design can be represented with a model matrix like so:
```{r}
X <- matrix(c(1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1),nrow=6)
rownames(X) <- c("a","a","b","b","c","c")
```
which results in a matrix that looks like
```{r}
X
```
Suppose that the fitted values for the linear model are given by:
```{r}
beta <- c(10,3,-3)
```
What is the fitted value for the B samples?
```{r}
X[3:4,]%*%beta
```
What is the fitted value for the C samples?
```{r}
X[5:6,]%*%beta
```
